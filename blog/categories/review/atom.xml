    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article is specific to cellular levels of consolidation and so a bunch of it isn’t relevant to my work. The theory of synaptic and capture has some interesting associations. First, the idea that the moment after encoding requires critical events for persisting the memory. How exactly this memory persists can involve some different options (e.g., BDNF is sufficient on its own). Second, is a link to factors such as novelty (release dopamine) and context (?) that we know are important on the systems level but here we can understand a cellular basis. For instance, in the case of a prior context or schema, this might more quickly lead to tagging of the new element in that context/schema, which provides a greater likelihood that the new item will be remembered.</p>

<p>One thing I wonder if maintenance of some of these cellular processes is dependent on re-play. That is without the replay, there would be some degradation. Now there isn’t much work here that pertains to this, however we should note that with the fMRI when we measure replay it happens within the time-window for synaptic consolidation. So a few possibilities exist here, the replay at the systems level occurs independently of the cellular or that there is some synergy or one is required for the other…TODO: think through this.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>An initial point in the article that I like is that the memory trace is distributed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>specific memory traces are not stored within individual neurons, still less at a single synaptic within individual neurons, still less at a single synaptic location, but are distributed in an overlapping manner   across multiple neurons and synapses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article however focuses I think on more local processes specifically the cellular components of consolidation. It discusses the fact that a synapse can have a possibility for LTM but persistence requires additional factors that happen after encoding.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A core concept of the STC hypothesis is that memory encoding creates the potential for LTM but is noncommittal with respect to whether persistent memory will actually occur (FIG. 1).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>determining the fate of successive memories only at the time of encoding would be extremely complicated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="original-stc-hypothesis">Original STC Hypothesis</h2>

<p>LTP has the following steps: </p>

<ol>
  <li>the expression of synaptic potentiation with the setting of a local synaptic tag;</li>
  <li>the synthesis and distribution of plasticity-related proteins (PrPs); </li>
  <li>the capture of these proteins by tagged synapses; </li>
  <li>the ultimate stabilization of synaptic strength. if the prior activity history of the neuron has upregulated the availability of PrPs in a particular dendritic compartment, these will be captured by local synaptic tags and so ensure the sta- bilization of the synaptic component of a new memory trace soon after it is encoded</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, the prior or subsequent context of the animal will be very important as to whether a memory trace is stored.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>

<p>The paper then discusses how some of these steps don’t necessarily need to follow one another (e.g., E-LTP can coexist with a state in which a synaptic tag has not been set or has been blocked) and some other issues.</p>

<p>For instance, slow-onset LTP can also lead to memory being encoding/stored. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Slow-onset LTP is also seen following place cell activity replay, in which patterns of two place cells recorded during exploration of an environment are used as inputs for in vitro experiments in spike timing-dependent plasticity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s also a dissociation between functional changes in synaptic strength and structural changes but simply a change in the structure alone is insufficient for long-term LTP.</p>

<h2 id="revised-stc-hypothesis">Revised STC Hypothesis</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>The induction of E-LTP trigger two separate processes — one associated with increasing the functional strength of the synapse, the other with altering the structure of the synapse. When these occur alone, only a transitory change in synaptic strength is observed. However, when accompanied by the delivery of PRPs, a more lasting increase in synaptic strength occurs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arrival and capture of PRPs is essential for stabilization. Without them, any change will go backwards.</p>

<p>Remember that tagging occurs for the synapse and not a particular molecule.</p>

<h3 id="limitation">Limitation</h3>

<p>This is still only for in vitro and links missing for in vivo, although it’s assumed that same processes work for in vivo.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For reference details see <a href="/bibliography/Clopath_2012jo.html">Details</a> or the brief reference at the end <a href="#Clopath:2012jo">(Clopath, 2012)</a>.</p>

<h2 id="model">Model</h2>

<p>The article discusses a synaptic plasticity model, which has three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Tagging:</strong> The synapse strength is the sum of two parts, the weight of the early phase and the weight of the late phase. The early weight can be in a neutral state, high state, or low state. If the early weight is in a high state or low state, it is automatically tagged. The state of the early weight switches from neutral to high with a probability given by a Hebbian rule for the induction of plasticity.</li>
  <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> If the number of tags exceeds a threshold, plasticity-related proteins are synthesized. The threshold depends on the phasic dopamine level, such that if dopamine is high, the threshold is lowered. Can see this effect, if place a rat in inhibitory avoidance training following being in a novel environment. That is novelty can lower this threshold.</li>
  <li><strong>Consolidation:</strong> The late weight of the synapse is a continuous variable with two stable states. If plasticity-related proteins are available and if the synapse is tagged, the late-weight will go to the upper stable state if eLTP was induced, lower if eLTD was induced.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>They mention in the article “On a higher level, it is not clear how this synaptic consolidation is linked to the consolidation by transferring memories from different brain areas typically happening during rest and sleep”. This is important…it’s unclear to me as well. The article does draw some links between synapse and more psychological concepts (e.g., dopamine levels related to the novelty and the likelihood to consolidate memories).</p>

<h2 id="future-thoughts">Future Thoughts</h2>

<p>I’m wondering if the synaptic tagging model could have analogues to schema representation in the mPFC. It’s been shown that learning of congruent information is processed in the mPFC <a href="#vanKesteren:2012hj">(van Kesteren, Ruiter, Fernández and Henson, 2012)</a> and this area shows up-regulation of memory relevant genes in the rat immediately after learning <a href="#Tse:2011ee">(Tse, Takeuchi, Kakeyama, Kajii, Okuno, Tohyama, Bito and Morris, 2011)</a>. This suggests that information is tagged both here in the mPFC and in the hippocampus for schema representations along with increases in activity. The combination of increased activity (akin to LTP) and genetic up-regulation (akin to synaptic tagging), we might expect long-term memory storage.</p>
