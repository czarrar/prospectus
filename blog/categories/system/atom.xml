<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ribot…first to envisage that memories might be processed over time (…Ribot gradient)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Muller and Pilzecker were the first to use the term consolidation to describe the post-acquisition processes that stabilize memories thus explaining retroactive interference</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Which is the time course of memory consolidation?</li>
  <li>Is consolidation a unitary process?</li>
  <li>What are the brain regions engaged in consolidation?</li>
  <li>How can the brain form persistent memories?</li>
  <li>How is information in structures of the MTL transferred for ultimate consolidation in the neocortex?</li>
</ol>

<p>And why this sequence of events occurs in some but not all memories?</p>

<h3 id="invertebrates">Invertebrates</h3>

<p>Two phases [22,31,43,53,54]:</p>

<ol>
  <li>short-term memory: protein and RNA synthesis-independent lasts mins to hours</li>
  <li>long-term memory: protein and RNA synthesis-dependent that lasts several hours to days, weeks, etc</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="hebb">Hebb</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>wealth of evidence demonstrated that cell assemblies work together to represent information in the brain [57]. no single memory “center” exists.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="cellular-and-systems-consolidation">Cellular and systems consolidation</h2>

<p>Types types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Synaptic/cellular consolidation: Fast molecular and cellular events occurring early after training and lasting no more than several hours to a few days in particular brain regions engaged in acquisition and early processing of new information</li>
  <li>Systems consolidation: Slow and entails the participation of neo-cortical regions and their interactions with the MTL that reorganize the recently learned material</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that if consolidation of new information involves interactions with an already stored associative “schema” systems consolidation can be rapid [89].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>systems and cellular consolidation are interdependent, because the synaptic consolidation product (a stable memory trace in the hippocampus) must last long enough to permit systems consolidation processes to work</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="lesion-imaging-and-pharmacological-evidence-for-system-consolidation">Lesion, imaging, and pharmacological evidence for system consolidation</h2>

<p>Mostly MTL lesions lead to a graded retrograde amnesia with recent memories spared. However, these lesions lead to ungraded (flat) retrograde amnesia for spatial memory in the Morris water maze.</p>

<h3 id="time-lag">Time Lag</h3>

<p>Gist is that it takes time to get to LTM but in certain cases it can be immediate.</p>

<p>Takshami et al [82] find the largest decrease in hippocampal activity (and increase in vmPFC activity) between days 1 and 2, an interval of time without a decrease in memory performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>for certain learning tasks new information is consolidated and stored in neocortical structures from the time of training and this is needed for memory recall [10,21,44-46,60,89]</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="acc">ACC</h3>

<p>In article say that question of ACC’s involvement in storage vs retrieval is unanswered. It has been known to be involved with retrieval of remote memories [33,58], although from some other stuff I saw it was possible that the ACC came online only to resolve difficult to remember things or stuff that was being forget…so it was more involved in cognitive control and less with particular memory processes [Rudy et al., 72].</p>

<h3 id="late-consolidation">Late Consolidation</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are tempted to suggest that rather than looking for specific sites of late consolidation of a particular learning experience, it might be wiser to view consolidation as the result of complex interactions between different brain regions, each using its own sequence of molecular and cellular events.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>the hippocampus more engaged in rapid encoding of events and their sequence while detailed memory representations are likely contained within distributed neocortical areas [30] but see [61]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>it is surprising the paucity of work done to unravel the neurobiological bases of experience-induced cortical reorganization (58 for references)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="alternate-view-to-standard-model">Alternate view to standard model</h2>

<h3 id="multiple-trace-theory">Multiple trace theory</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>hippocampus is essential for the storage and retrieval of detailed episodic and spatial memories independently of the age of the memory</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>however, semantic memories and schematic representations of the topography are hippocampus-independent.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>in other words, insofar as memories represent detailed information, they are dependent on hippocampal circuits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So with replay of memories that are observed, the multiple trace theory would predict that a new trace would be generated within the hippocampus, whereas the standard model would say that there is a reorganization in cortical areas to better process this information.</p>

<h3 id="other-theories">Other Theories</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>one theory proposes that remote memories are stored in the neocortex, but the hippocampus retains a critical role in their retrieval [86]. here, the hippocampus does not contain the memory trace representing an experience but it provides an index that enables the trace to be retrieved.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>other theory proposes that new information is consolidated and stored solely in the hippocampus [51,63]</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="persistence-of-long-term-memory-storage">Persistence of long-term memory storage</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Few works have assessed the involvement of the hippocampus in memory persistence, probably because of the dominant idea that the hippocampus appears to have a temporary role in memory storage [98]; see [33] for references.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>first study that demonstrated a lasting process in the hippocampus required for LTM consolidation…[70]…found that hippocampal neural activity is needed for consolidation/storage of spatial info during 5 days after training rats in a water maze.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>mounting evidence that different types of glutamate receptors undergo long-lasting changes and/or are needed at very late post-training time points in the hippocampus [16,70,76]</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>it is feasible that these long-lasting changes may well facilitate reactivations of the hippocampal circuit and may entrain extrahippocampal structures in which the memory trace is eventually stored.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>several findings suggest that the persistence of memory trace for the first several days post learning is important in establishing remote memories [76,93].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I view this as possibly suggesting that replay at the initial periods are important in solidifying the memory, which will dependent on changes in cortical synaptic plasticity and morphology.</p>

<h3 id="persistence-of-the-initial-trace">Persistence of the initial trace</h3>

<p>A prediction of the standard model is that the hippocampal memory trace guides systems consolidation. To do so, the memory index in the hippocampus must last long enough to permit the initial steps of memory trace consolidation in the neocortex. In this context, persistence might be viewed as the process by which a “persistent” hippocampal trace enables the transfer of information to the cortex and the stabilization of this information.</p>

<h3 id="persistence-in-the-hippocampus">Persistence in the hippocampus</h3>

<p>It appears that BDNF appears to be important [7].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We also propose that LTM storage is achieved by recurrent rounds of consolidation-like protein synthesis-dependent processes and that induction of BDNF expression at this critical time point is important for the initiation of a cascade of molecular and cellular events that leads to synaptic remodeling and growth of new synaptic connections which are involved in various forms of LTM [6,49]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing not mentioned here is the prior hypothesis and those silent RNA things. Still need to look at those papers to get a more detailed understanding. However, regardless of those particular details, it appears persistence of the hippocampal trace in the initial hours/days is needed for a later process that produces the LTM.</p>
