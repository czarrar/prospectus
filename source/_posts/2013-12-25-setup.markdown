I'm switching to octopuses for this research blog. Here I'll chronicle my install setup and over time, I'll add steps for installing any additional extensions or themes.

## Basics

### Install

I first went through the steps listed in http://octopress.org/docs/setup. The one slight difference is that I used a previous rvmrc file in my main blog and I made sure to do this before `gem install bundler`. If I had wanted to create a new rvmrc file then I would run:

``` bash
rvm --rvmrc --create ruby-1.9.3-p286@gemset
```

I made sure to leave the directory and re-enter it to allow the dvm settings to kick in. I also switched to using kramdown instead of rdiscount as I was getting an install error and also because later I will need to switch to kramdown anyway (for some plugin).

### Deploy

I then followed the github project pages instructions: http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github. 

## Themes

There were several themes that peaked my interest. Below is a list.

* https://github.com/roberto/oct2-orange
* https://github.com/bijumon/oct2
* https://github.com/amay077/octoflat
* https://github.com/alexharris/calm-shallow-sea
* https://github.com/ryandeussing/octopress-minimalist
* https://github.com/rezajatnika/greyjoy

And now the code to 

``` bash
git submodule add git://github.com/roberto/oct2-orange.git .themes/oct2-orange
git submodule add https://github.com/bijumon/oct2.git .themes/oct2
git submodule add https://github.com/alexgaribay/octoflat .themes/octoflat
git submodule add git://github.com/alexharris/calm-shallow-sea.git .themes/calm-shallow-sea
git submodule add git://github.com/ryandeussing/octopress-minimalist.git .themes/minimalist
git submodule add git://github.com/rezajatnika/greyjoy.git .themes/greyjoy
```
