This is a review paper. The authors propose an _active system consolidation_ of memory wherein _"newly encoded memory representations become redistributed to other neuron networks serving as long-term store"_. This is to be distinguished with a more passive system consolidation that I believe protects a memory from retrograde interference. In this case, there is no difference in the actual memory trace, it is just less susceptible to being erased or having other irrelevant information interfere (e.g., overwrite).
