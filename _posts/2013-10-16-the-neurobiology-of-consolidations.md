I've begun to read the Dudai 2004 review on consolidation. I can't believe I haven't read this till now since it is a pretty foundational review. Thus far, I've gone through the basics and learned about synaptic and system consolidation. I like the way the author frames things as questions such as why might consolidation happen in the first place? I will definitely need to read through this paper a second time to digest all of the material.

One thing I wonder is how synaptic consolidation (changes in gene and protein stuff) might be reflected with fMRI. One thing is that synaptic consolidation should lead to differences in firing rate, which would be reflected in differences in connectivity within the hippocampus/MTL such as differences in the pattern of connectivity. Maybe there is also a more direct way for synaptic changes to be shown in BOLD?

I also just read through the section about criticisms to consolidation. Generally, it seems like many of the criticisms like how amnesics can be primed to remember things (which is likely to reflect fast mapping or non-declarative memories) are not fully warranted. There are however still many unresolved questions. One of my favorites is if the synaptic consolidation even reflects in the later representation of the memory trace.
